## **Goals**

Migrate clients from traditional tracking methods to a server side solution where we aim to improve the quality of traffic being sent to marketing destinations, comply with privacy laws, and improve on accuracy. Thus improving the attributed results giving a clearer picture of marketing activities. 

## Methodology

- **Setup**: Create an sGTM container in a cloud service and link it to the web GTM container.
- **Configure Tags**: Move and configure key tags (e.g., GA4, Meta Pixel) in sGTM.
- **Data Layer**:  Ensure clean and structured data flows from web GTM to sGTM.
- **Test**: Validate data flow, debug, and resolve errors.
- **Launch**: Deploy sGTM live, monitor performance, and optimise continuously.

We can make use of custom loaders, cookie keepers & no SQL databases to store user data and annon user identification.
