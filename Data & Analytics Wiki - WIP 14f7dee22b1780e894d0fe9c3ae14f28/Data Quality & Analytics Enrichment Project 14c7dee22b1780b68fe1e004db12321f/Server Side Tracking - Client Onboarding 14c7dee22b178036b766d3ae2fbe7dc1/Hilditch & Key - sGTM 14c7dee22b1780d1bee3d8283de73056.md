## Methodology

---

- **Setup**: Create an sGTM container in a cloud service and link it to the web GTM container.
- **Configure Tags**: Move and configure key tags (e.g., GA4, Meta Pixel) in sGTM.
- **Data Layer**:  Ensure clean and structured data flows from web GTM to sGTM.
- **Test**: Validate data flow, debug, and resolve errors.
- **Launch**: Deploy sGTM live, monitor performance, and optimise continuously.

We can make use of custom loaders, cookie keepers & no SQL databases to store user data and unique user_id.
