### Containers

When you start working with GTM, the first thing you‚Äôll need to do is create a container. A container essentially ‚Äúholds‚Äù all the tags for your site.

After creating a new container, GTM gives you some code to add to your site. This is your container code and it will need to be added to the source code so it displays on each page of your site.

### Workspaces

A workspace allows you to create multiple sets of changes for your container. Team members can work on changes in separate workspaces to independently develop their own tag configurations. This feature helps with version control by enabling you to revert changes to a previous workspace configuration, and helps prevent teammates from inadvertently publishing someone else's unfinished changes.

### Environments

The environments feature in Google Tag Manager is ideal for organizations that want to preview their container changes in a test environment before those changes are published. This feature is useful for organizations that use multi-tiered environments in their development workflow (e.g. 'development', 'staging', and 'production'.)

### **Introduction to Google Tag Manager (GTM)**

**what is it?**

Google Tag Manager allows you to manage and deploy marketing, analytics, and functionality tags (small pieces of code or tracking pixels) on a website wiithout having to modify the code directly on the site.

### how **is it useful?**

Here are a few characteristics and uses of a Tag Manager:

1. **Simplify tag management:**¬†It allows digital marketers to deploy, edit, or remove tags from a user-friendly web interface, without requiring much assistance from developers. This saves time and reduces the potential for coding errors.
2. **Improve Site Speed:**¬†By loading tags asynchronously, tag managers can potentially improve website loading speeds, providing a better user experience.
3. **Support for numerous tags:**¬†They support many different tags, including Google Analytics, Google Ads, Facebook Pixels, Twitter, LinkedIn, and many other third-party tags.
4. **Event tracking:**¬†They can track various user actions like clicks, form submissions, page views, or shopping cart abandonment, providing crucial insights into user behaviors.
5. **Version Control:**¬†They track versions each time you publish changes, which is useful when diagnosing issues or reverting changes.
6. **User Permissions:**¬†They allow you to control who has access to make changes.

### **who uses it?**

Google Tag Manager (GTM) is primarily used by the following individuals or groups within an organization:

1. **Digital Marketers:**¬†They use GTM to track the performance of their online marketing campaigns across different platforms (Google Ads, Facebook, Twitter, etc.). They can add and adjust their own tracking codes (tags) without needing to ask a developer to do so.
2. **SEO Specialists:**¬†They can better optimize websites by tracking specific user actions and events for insights.
3. **Website Developers:**¬†GTM can help minimize the amount of tracking code directly in website source code, making sites cleaner, easier to manage, and potentially faster. It also reduces the tasks for developers, as they don't need to constantly add, remove, or change tracking code as per marketers' demands.
4. **Data Analysts or Data Scientists:**¬†They use GTM to collect specific data in a suitable structure that's required for their analysis and reports.
5. **UX Designers:**¬†They can use the event tracking feature to gather more insights on user behaviour, informing data-driven design decisions.
6. **Ecommerce Managers:**¬†For ecommerce websites, managers can implement multiple pixels or tags for retargeting, tracking conversions or understanding user behavior, thereby enhancing the online shopping experience.

So, although GTM is relevant to anyone dealing with website or app data, it's typically managed by those in marketing and web development roles.

### **How does it work?**

- Container containst tags
- Tags do things
- Set rules for how you want tags to get ‚Äútriggered‚Äù
- Use variables spice up things

<aside>
üí° **Tags:** A tag is a snippet of JavaScript that sends information to a third party, such as Google. Tags collect data, target your ad campaigns, track ads, and perform other functions.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° **Triggers**: A trigger listens to your web page or mobile app for certain events like form submissions, button clicks, or page views. The trigger tells the tag to fire when the specified event is detected. Every tag must have at least one trigger in order to fire.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° **Variables:** A variable is a named placeholder for a value that is populated when code is run. These could be things such as a product name, a price value, or a date.

### Planning implementation

Before ever setting foot in GTM, map out what tags you will be using and why. This will prevent you from implementing unnecessary tags and will provide a roadmap for setting up your GTM container.

- Show the onnit work
    - requirements
    - tags
    - triggers
    - variables

### Setting up the container  ****

- Create your workspace (best practice)
    
    **Workspace:** workspace enable multiple people to work together without undoing their work. A workspace allows you to create multiple sets of changes for your container. Team members can work on changes in separate workspaces to independently develop their own tag configurations. This feature helps with version control by enabling you to revert changes to a previous workspace configuration, and helps prevent teammates from inadvertently publishing someone else's unfinished changes.

- Creating a tags
    - What type of task are there?
        - **Built in Tags:** GTM offers built-in tags for common tools like Google Analytics, Google Ads, and others which you should use as much as possible before resorting to custom HTML tags.
        - Tag library (GA, Mixpanel, Google, Hotjar etc..)
        - Custom HTML
- Setting up a trigger
    - Understanding triggers
    - Creating your first triggers (e.g., for page views, clicks)
        
         triggers, are used to 'listen' for specific interactions such as clicks, form submissions, or timer intervals. Once an interaction is detected, it can trigger a tag.
        
        *Pros:*
        
        - Useful for setting up basic event tracking, such as all link clicks or form submissions without needing custom JavaScript code.
        - Click-related triggers can often extract extra details about the clicked elements.
        
        *Cons:*
        
        - Listeners may not detect activity occurring within iFrames or single page applications, unless implemented correctly.
        - Listeners can't always capture detailed, custom data or more complex user interactions.
- Using variables
    - Type of variables
        - built-in
            - Understanding and activating built-in variables
            - How and when to use built-in variables
            - **Built-In Variables and Auto-Event Listeners:**
            
            Built-in variables and auto-event listeners allow you to gather data automatically without needing to utilize the data layer.
            
            Built-in Variables:
            
            GTM has many built-in variables such as Page URL, Referrer, Click Classes, Form ID, and more.
            
            *Pros:*
            
            - Easy to enable and use.
            - Good for simple tracking needs and doesn't typically require coding knowledge.
            
            *Cons:*
            
            - More limited in what they can gather compared to the data layer.
            - If your tracking needs become more complex, built-in variables might not be sufficient.
        - custom

Built-in variables and auto-event listeners can handle most simple and moderately complex tracking needs. If you're just setting up basic event tracking or sending data to Google Analytics, these should suffice.

For more advanced, detailed, and specific data, like customer ID, product details, user roles, or tracking enhanced e-commerce interactions, you'll want to use the data layer.

### Working with the data layer

**Data Layer:** Data layer variables enable Tag Manager to read values from your data layer implementation and pass those values to tags, triggers, and other variables. A data layer object is made up of a list of key/value pairs.

Understanding and effectively using the data layer is a critical part of using GTM proficiently. The data layer is essential for more advanced tracking needs.

- What is the data layer and why is it important?
    - The data layer is a JavaScript array that stores data about the interaction occurring on the page and then passes that data to GTM. It's one of the more advanced aspects of GTM but also one of its most powerful.
- How to push data to the data layer
- How to pull data from the data layer

*Pros:*

- Flexible and customisable. You can send any type of data (event, transaction, warning, etc.) to GTM.
- Data can be securely transmitted from your website to GTM.
- Use it for setting up enhanced ecommerce tracking, custom events, or to track data that isn't normally available through GTM variables.

*Cons:*

- Requires JavaScript knowledge and often needs a developer to implement, especially when dealing with complex or custom data.
- If not implemented correctly, it can lead to incorrect data collection.

*To use the data layer properly, you need to work in collaboration with your development team to push the necessary data into the data layer.*

### **Testing and Debugging**

**Test Before You Publish**¬†

 Always test your tags before publishing them to ensure they're working as intended.

**Using GTM‚Äôs Preview and Debug mode**

GTM features a Preview and Debug mode that allows you to see exactly how tags behave before they're live.

**Tips for testing and troubleshooting tags**

- Always validate end results in the destination
- Using debugger to see if there is a problem with values

### Publish

Environments: 

The environments feature in Google Tag Manager is ideal for organizations that want to preview their container changes in a test environment before those changes are published. This feature is useful for organizations that use multi-tiered environments in their development workflow (e.g. 'development', 'staging', and 'production'.) [Learn More](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6311518?hl=en)

1. **Use Versioning and Comments:**¬†GTM automatically saves each published version of your container, which can be incredibly useful for debugging. Additionally, leaving comments for each change can help not just you, but anyone else who needs to understand your logic later.

1. **Regularly Review and Tidy Up Your Container:**¬†It's a good practice to periodically review your GTM setup and remove or pause irrelevant or unused tags, which can have an impact on page load speed.

1. **Adhere to Privacy Regulations:**¬†Make sure you're compliant with GDPR, CCPA, or any other relevant privacy regulations pertaining to the collection and handling of user data.

### **Best Practices for Using GTM**

- Naming conventions, notes, and organization tips
    - **Use a Consistent Naming Convention:**¬†Having a structured and consistent naming convention for tags, triggers, and variables makes it easier to locate and manage them as your GTM container grows.
    - **Use Folders to Organize your Tags, Triggers, and Variables:**¬†This makes managing a large number of tags, triggers, and variables much easier, and it‚Äôs especially important in websites or accounts with multiple users.
- Version control
- User permissions and collaboration in GTM
