Meta is massively over inflated, currently the store had simprosys delivering data, the sales channel & Pandectes sending event data to meta all leading to multiple over inflated results. 

Iâ€™m unable to turn off the sales channel so we have switched simprosys and Pandectes off. 

On the 8th December meta saw 48 purchase events. if deduplication is not working this could be seen as 48 individual purchases, not 14 reported on by the store.

Only 19% of events have an event ID meaning a lot of events have been interpreted by meta as unique events
