Rob from google is able to help us look at budget forecasting with the internal tools he has. It will tell use opportunities for high spending months and low spending ones.

Kyle - would be useful to start predicting est results based on spend.

Need to identify the current goals. ROAS driven? Revenue target? We need to work out the ROI, if there are profitability margins to make sure we are always above these. This will also help us understand new customer accusation costs. 

Rob will send over a budget formula for utilisation. This will tell us how much of the daily allocated budget is actually getting used.
