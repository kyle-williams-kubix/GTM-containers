New creatives uploaded to the platform and can be seen here: https://www.figma.com/design/LAeesRQTjCV8xzlQspm46P/MARK24---Ark-Wildlife?node-id=710-238&node-type=frame&t=AZWOpjWPvmgWmL5I-0

I also pushed a new strategy where we are using the top row for TOF ads, the middle row for MOF ads and the bottom row is used to BOF ads alongside dyn ads. 

Question to be raised is product sets, what product types should be pushed? bird food over accessories?
