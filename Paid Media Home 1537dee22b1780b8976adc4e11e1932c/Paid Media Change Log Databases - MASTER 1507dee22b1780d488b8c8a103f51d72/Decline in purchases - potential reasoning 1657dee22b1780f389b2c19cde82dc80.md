After BFCM, we started to see a decline in the revenue and retargeting performance. It was highlighted ROAS tanked but I made a comment around exhausting the conversion funnel after a successful BFCM period. 

Nearly a month later, looking at some custom metrics setup on meta we can start to see the blockers causing slowdowns. 

*last 14 days compared to previous period.*

Firstly our CPM at the account level is up by 71%, we can see the retargeting CPM is starting to decline indicating new users entering the funnel but given the time of year, our prospecting efforts are still seeing rising CPM’s cause our efforts to cost more.

The amount spent has dropped as we would expect but it doesn't help the situation.

We can also see that purchases over £5 (essentially non swatch purchases) are down by 97%

Swatch purchases are down at the account level by 35% but the swatch purchase campaign is up by 220% indicating we’re pushing new users through the conversion funnel as intended.

This is further backed by looking at the increase in content views from initially the prospecting campaign followed by the swatch focused campaign. This is indicating users that are being retargeted for a swatch campaign are continuing to browse products before ordering a swatch.
