Update Type: Routine Checks

Performance has been slow but gradually increased over time. Looking at splitting out products into different asset groups, thoughts are to start with shirts. GA4 is only reporting on product types so will start here and assess performance from there.

- Last 14 days
- Attributed purchases on meta is currently at 4, with a value of £799.84.
- Attributed purchases on Google is currently at 15, with a value of £3,151.15

Current thoughts - meta may play a bit of a backseat when it comes to converting users due to the AVG purchase value. Will consider putting more focus towards TOF & MOF activity and leave Google to pickup these users and convert creating a more structured omnichanel approach. 

Changes made:

- Increased budget
- Changed branded search goal to max Conv. Value
- Added in a brand inclusion list so we can use broad match keywords but maintain relevancy.
- Testing dynamic retargeting campaigns on meta based on users interactions on the website.
