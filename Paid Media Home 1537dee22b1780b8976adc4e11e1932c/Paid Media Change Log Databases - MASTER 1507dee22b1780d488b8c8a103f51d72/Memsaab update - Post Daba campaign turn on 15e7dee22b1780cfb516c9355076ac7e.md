We had complaints that ROAS on meta has dropped. We have fixed tracking to stop it from over reporting hence the ROAS figure should now be somewhat more accurate. 

We also turned back on the BOF DABA ad and since seen 46% increase in purchase value, 31% increase in meta ROAS and 60% jump up in purchase. 

EOY assets have also increased in performance, BOF retargeting is up by 12% looking at ROAS and purchase value, with an 24% increase in purchases. Content views and add to carts have dropped but overall they have increased on an account level, most likely due to the fact these users are going through the BOF prospecting (DABA) campaign instead disrupting the user journey flow. 

The only things that stand out to me is the creative between the daba and EOY campaigns are totally different. The EOY stuff also has not been live for as long as the DABA campaign meaning it has much less learnings.
