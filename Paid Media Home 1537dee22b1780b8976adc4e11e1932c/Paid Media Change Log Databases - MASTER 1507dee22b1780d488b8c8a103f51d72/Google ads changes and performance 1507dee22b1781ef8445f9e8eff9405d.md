Google Ads has been struggling to spend. 

I think this is off the back of the tracking issue we saw towards the start of the month. Tracking went down completely on the 19th and performance has not recovered. 

We have changed the bidding on the campaigns, we have set things to max conversions in the hope that we can push sales much more.

Iâ€™ve also changed the budgets to reflect the currently daily budgets in the media plan.

I expect to see delayed attribution from this. On meta, we have pushed a load of budget into TOF for content views
