**Meta**

Comparing the last 30 days the previous 30 days

- CPM (cost per 1000 users) is up by 53% on meta meaning we have to spend harder or more efficiently to reach the same / more people than we were before - **high demand**
- Cost per click is also up by 36.7% - **high demand**
- Our CTR is up by 12% on meta indicating we have moved to be more effective at getting the right users to click making better use of our budget and reduce ad spend wastage.
- Our reach has improved by 76%  17k too 278K - pair this with the improved CTR, this indicates more users and being driven to the website. We can confirm this because:
    - Content views is up by 35%
    - Add to carts are up by 102% *(this seems excessively high and could be a tracking issue but i cant tell based on my tests)*
    - Purchases are up by 24%
    - Purchase value is up by 12.9%
- ROAS is down by 53% (from 6x to 2.85x) & cost per purchase is up by 92% (from £14.09 to £29.25).

Last 12 months we can see performance has been on a decline since August.

Google ads shows a similar decline, cost as gradually decreased.

The actual store has also continued to decline so it’s only correct to see this reflected in ads.

When planning for BFCM, this concern with the AM that we needed to start increasing budgets from October to ensure we have a powerful end of year. This was not done and we are seeing the effects of that now. 

Strategic implementation has not changed for the worse. we have seen improved performance looking at the last 30days over the previous 30days. 

Comparing YoY - 

Google ads were gaining more clicks, more visibility but not seeing users convert via the site. spend is down by 4% looking at the last 30 days compared to the previous 30 days but conversions, value and Conv. Rate is all down. ROAS remains strong. 

Cost per conversion is up 30% YoY, ROAS is down by 17% on Google 1300% to 1100%.

Another note on our ads more towards being more cost effective is frequency. We have dropped this by 10% indicating we’re not wasting money showing ads to people that are not going to purchase. 

Changes made - Directing prospecting campaigns to optimise for content views instead of landing page views or purchases. Although this may sound counter intuitive, the goal is is to target more of the right people and less of the wrong people. We see this from the metrics above driving more intent and demand for Retargeting activity to pick up.

GA4 Data -

- last 30days, 20% increase in new users
    - meta is up by 89% when looking at driving new users.
    - TikTok is down by 21%
    - Google is only up by 3%
- Google is up 9.5% on attributed purchases
    - Previously it was down by 30% which helps to prove the improvements we are seeing on meta in regards to reaching content views ect is also filtering into google ads.
    
    This is the only form of attribution we can look at in GA4. note, only google and the third party checkouts are showing in this report. 
    
    js.klarna and payfort are claiming actioned along the user journey.

What is happening is users are landing from meta, going through these checkout gateways and the data being sent back to the platforms are not going to be reflective of the users source. Meta wont know if it’s converted someone so it’ll take a educated guess. This give us bad data into the platform and makes meta optimise the wrong thing. 

Looking at the traffic acquisition report, paid social is up there with the number of sessions and engagement rates and avg engagement time is up there with googles paid shopping. I suspect the data being passed back to meta is dirty causing inconsistencies which would result in figures like ROAS to be wildly inaccurate. it also means we have no clear way to understand a users journey.

i don’t have any insights to email performance but if attributed add to carts have risen, this could also indicate revenue is being taken away from meta and attributed to email?
