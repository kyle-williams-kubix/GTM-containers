MTD snapshot:

TikTok continues to drive conversions, spend is down by 9% so conversions have dropped by 7%. 

Meta Prospecting had an ad set split for feed and stories / Reels. this placement hardly was shown so it was turned off and budget is just in feed. 

Looking at the account as a whole, ad spend is up by 177% comparing to the start of November, looking at the Last 7days compared to the previous 7 days shows spend is up by 185% also. the CPA for Content views has gone up by 32%. This is most likely due to the increased spend and the campaigns having to relearn.

Add to carts are up by 293% with the cost per add to cart dropping by 30%. Purchases are up by 160% and CPA is slightly up by 6%. ROAS has dropped by 18%.

Looking at google, we are driving a 10.7x return. Conversions and value is up which is inline with the cost increasing. total sales per day are slowing down off the back off payday / BFCM so i expect to see this stabilise over the next week or so.
