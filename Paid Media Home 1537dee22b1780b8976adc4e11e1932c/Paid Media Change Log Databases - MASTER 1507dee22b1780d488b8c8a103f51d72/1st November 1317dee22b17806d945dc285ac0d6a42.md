- TOF budget increases and Targeting strategy changed to find new customers that have not interacted with the brand.

Meta

- Budget has been updated, ad sets have been reset into learning but given the increased budget it should exit fairly fast.
- Added a minimum budget spend for the two prospecting campaign ad sets to evenly distribute spend, (minimum 100/day)
- The MOF_PRO_VIDEOVIEWRTG ad set has been turned off as we phased out video views optimisation last month.
- Swatch retargeting is creative limited, ideally we need to look at a creative refresh for this section of the account.
- KBX_BOF_RETARGETING - ATC - budget updated,
- KBX_BOF_RETARGETING - PURCHASE - this campaign seems to be struggling over the last 14 days, tbf. itâ€™s goal is to act as a basket abandonment so purchases not going through here at high volume is okay as long as the stage prior (ATC) is generating sales, which it is.  488 adds to cart and 53 purchases. Alot has been swatch purchases indicating users are potentially buy multiple sets of swatches.
