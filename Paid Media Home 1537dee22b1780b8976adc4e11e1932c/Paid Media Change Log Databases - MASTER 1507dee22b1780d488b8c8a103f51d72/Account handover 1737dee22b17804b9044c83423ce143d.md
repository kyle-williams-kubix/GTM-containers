Took over the account and created a 2025 media plan. Yet to take a deeper look into the account to understand the current account format, budget allocation and performance. 

Minor changes that have been noted - Meta TOF is optimising for landing page views, planing to change these to an event such as engaged users or content views. 

Ad set budget optimisation was in use. Changed this to be Campaign budget optimisation to allow meta / the data to dictate where spend goes and avoid any potential missed opportunities. 

Budgets are updated to reflect spend in the media plan.
