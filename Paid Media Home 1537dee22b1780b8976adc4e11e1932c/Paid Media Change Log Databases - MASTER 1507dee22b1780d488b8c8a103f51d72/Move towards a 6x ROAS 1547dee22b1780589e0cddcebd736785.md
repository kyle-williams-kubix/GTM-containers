Client wants to move towards focusing on obtaining a 6x ROAS. We have adjusted budgets to work towards a 50k spend for December and changed target ROAS to be 600%. 

Brand terms will continue to have a Â£150/day budget but this means it may cannibalise sales. 

I have my doubts about this move. Email thread can be seen here: https://app.frontapp.com/open/cnv_nl2xxe2?key=ZpXO1wQEajwQS_RczAhf0BJjgAFrVvbs
