Update Type: Reactive

- Found an issue with GA4 double counting transaction, revenue seems  spot on. Issue seems to come from the web container since the sGTM container is 95% accurate.
- Turned off checkout extensibility for now as itâ€™s not fully configured.
- Added the sGTM GA4 account into google ads
- Swapped google ads goals to sGTM tags
- Checked to ensure goals are fully aligned
