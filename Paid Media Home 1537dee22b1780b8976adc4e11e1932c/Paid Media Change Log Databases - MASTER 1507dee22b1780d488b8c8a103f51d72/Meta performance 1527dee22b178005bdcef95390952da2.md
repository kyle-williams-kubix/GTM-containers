Meta currently has two campaigns running BOF Prospecting and BOF Retargeting. Looking at the L14 days, KBX_BOF_RETARGETING has produced the majority of purchases at Â£3.30 each

- KBX_BOF_PROSPECTING: AVG CPA is Â£7.23, comparing to the previous 14Days, CPA has dropped by 26.5%
    - I believe this is because we stopped any upper funnel activity so the BOF Prospecting campaign is now picking up those users that would have filtered into the BOF Retargeting campaign.
- Frequency is starting to rise, 94% up compared to the previous period. Main difference is pausing any prospecting activity.

Next steps? 

- Consistent reporting
- Re-introduce MOF activity,
- Remove BOF_Prospecting for the new year.

Optimise for BOF RTG as a basket abandonment.
