Meta appears to be pushing a lot of sales with attributing 10.4k in revenue. upon further investigation, a lot of the attributed revenue is being driven from view through conversions as opposed to users clicking and taking an action. 

Nothing wrong with this but understanding how users interact with the brand is pretty useful.  

Weâ€™re running an advantage+ campaign on meta at the moment and google is slow. last 7 days has shown 2 conversions with meta doubling that with 4. 

We can see that [oxgrills.co.uk](http://oxgrills.co.uk) is currently bidding on the brand term. Our ads are winning but its something to keep an eye on for sure. 

Bid strategy has been changed to max.conv on the brand campaign. Iâ€™ve also changed the PMAX campaign to be max.conv to help push purchases.
