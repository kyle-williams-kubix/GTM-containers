# FURNICOMP - New user journey

Owner: Ky

Previous Journey

- MOF was optimised for landing page views
- BOF RTG had a higher spend that MOF prospecting causing frequency to jump up.
- BOF Prospecting is taking all the conversions but give us little data to know who / how for optimising.

G --> B3

```

New approach

- TOF Prospecting now optimises for content views targeting a range of audiences from lookalikes and detailed targeting. campaign goal is set to conversions so we will see a section of users go straight to purchase which is okay, it’s mimicking the BOF prospecting but we more split our audiences creative ect.
- BOF ads should then be dynamic shopping campaigns retargeting users based on the products they have viewed or added to basket but not brought to then dynamically share recommendations.
- BOF retargeting will then retarget users that have added to the cart within the past 90 days.
- BOF prospecting has a reduced budget of £10/day to slowly faze it out.

Further iterations 

TOF not needed for this brand? Potential audiences is perceived to be price driven so brand work may not be suitable.
