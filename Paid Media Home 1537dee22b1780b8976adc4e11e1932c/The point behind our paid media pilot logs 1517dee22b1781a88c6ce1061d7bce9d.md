### **1. What Do We Want This Log to Achieve?**

- **Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive record of actions taken (flag checks, reactive checks, routine checks) and link them to performance changes.
- **Clarity**: Clearly document the "what" and "why" of every action for future reference, ensuring no ambiguity when reviewing past decisions.
- **Performance Analysis**: Help identify patterns by correlating positive and negative performance changes with specific actions taken.
- **Accountability**: Ensure a record exists for reviewing actions during performance evaluations or handovers.

### **2. Why Do We Need a Log?**

- **Accountability**: To track responsibilities and actions for individuals or teams. This ensures transparency and prevents duplication of work or missed tasks.
- **Handover/Continuity**: Makes onboarding or transitioning between team members seamless.
- **Learning Tool**: Aids in identifying successful strategies or avoiding repeating mistakes.
- **Audit Trail**: Provides a detailed history to defend decisions or strategies if questioned.

- **Teammates**: Ensures team members are aligned and can easily step into accounts when needed.
- **Leadership**: Offers insights into the team’s workflows and the efficacy of changes over time.

### **4. What Problems Is It Solving?**

- **Loss of Context**: Prevents confusion around why a change was made or when it occurred.
- **Missed Steps**: Ensures routine checks aren’t skipped or forgotten.
- **Handover Gaps**: Eliminates knowledge silos by documenting decisions and results.
- **Accountability Issues**: Allows for constructive feedback and tracking of task completion.

### **5. How Should It Be Organised?**

- **Core Structure**:
    - **Database Format**: Use a table or kanban board for flexibility.
    - **Filters/Tags**: Organise by Client, Campaign, Check Type (Routine, Reactive, Flag).
    - Putting it all in one database split by views eliminate ownership issues and means anyone can drill into an accounts change log by changing their filtered view.
    - **Custom Views**: Offer views for different users (e.g., detailed view for analysts, summary view for leadership).
- **Fields?**:
    - Date/Time.
    - Campaign or Account.
    - Check Type (Routine, Flag, Reactive).
    - Action Taken.
    - Reason for Action.
    - Metrics Monitored (CTR, CPA, ROAS).
    - Outcome (Observed Change or Expected Impact).
    - Responsible Person.

### **6. When Should It Be Updated?**

- **Real-Time**: Ideally, entries should be added as checks or changes are completed.
- **Daily/Weekly Review**: Schedule reviews for updates that couldn’t be logged immediately.
- **Critical Updates**: Flag changes tied to significant performance swings should be logged immediately for quick analysis.

---

### **7. Is There Any Need for Automations and Notification Handling?**

- **Notifications**:
    - Notify the team when a critical issue is flagged or when performance thresholds are exceeded - Notion automations directly into a slack channel or email.
    - Alert managers for overdue updates or incomplete logs?

---

### **8. Is There Any Information on How We Should Visualise This?**

- **Dashboards**:
    - Create summary dashboards with charts for key metrics and change frequency? might be overkill thinking forwards into how this would tie into a potential client hub or solving wider problems like media planning, campaign optimisation and planning, creative syndication ect.
    - Highlight performance trends linked to logged actions.
- **Filters and Views**:
    - Use dynamic filters to visualise logs by time frame, campaign, or check type.
    - Offer “Outcome Views” to quickly assess the impact of recent actions.
- **Heat maps / Performance Tags**:
    - Visual indicators for positive, negative, or neutral outcomes tied to logged actions.
